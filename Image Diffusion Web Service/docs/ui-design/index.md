Wireframe one is our main landing page. There is a search bar in the middle where users will type their prompts for the search engine to give their desired AI image results. Under the search bar, the image viewer boxes will be shown. Above the search bar, Imagebooth will be displayed as the title. Imagebooth's logo is displayed on the top left-hand side. The upload button is next to our name for users to be able to navigate to the image upload page. Three other buttons on the top tab bar will help users travel through our website. The first is "Discover" a page that consolidates and randomizes images found on our websites. Second is "Trend" which has a drop down menu with options prompt and model.
Last is "About" the page which shows facts about the team and our main reasons for making this website. Also, there's a light and dark mode button to let consumers choose their display style. The user icon is displayed in the top right corner. When the icon has been clicked a drop-down menu will let the user log in and create an account. Users must create an account to upload images.
